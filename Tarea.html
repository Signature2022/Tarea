			<h1> As We May Think By Vannevar Bush</h1>

			<p> This article created published in July 1945 actually does a really good job in predicting the future. I felt like it was really ahead of its time for the predictions that it was making. Today the things that it was mentioning might not be so aweing because today we are so used to what was being mentioned in the article, but in 1945 this type of stuff was unimaginable so I applaud the author for creating this type of predictions. This was a very good and informative read, I will definitely recommend to my friends to read this article as well. I am very happy how much of the predictions became reality </p>

			<h2>Long Live The Web By Tim Berners Lee</h2>

			<p>This article is a very informative article on how the world wide web and the internet work. It talks about what makes the internet and the world wide web the world wide web. There tends to be a lot of confusion between the two and these two terms are sometimes used interchangably but this article really clears up the differences between these two things. We see how these things starts and got to what we now know today as the internet and web. It is very informative and I highly recommend this read as well</p>
			<h3>Overall</h3>
